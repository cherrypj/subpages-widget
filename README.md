# Simple Subpages Sidebar Widget

For a client project, I needed a way to output the Parent and all child pages of that Parent page to a sidebar widget when browsing either the Parent or any one of the child pages.

I found an [existing Sub Pages Widget plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/subpages-widget/] that still worked, but you could only use the widget once. 

So I updated it. This plugin is now a multi-widget.

## To-Dos

* Right now, I just use all defaults. I'd like to give options.
* Tweak the title output to allow text before the title and after the title.
